# Brainf*ck Python why?
***Or bfpy for short***

This is a small bf interpreter written in python and designed to be highly portable

## Features
- dynamic array
- if you end up reaching the end of the array it will loop back to 0
- no negative numbers (it's a feature i swear)
- EOF is converted to -1 to respect C standard
- | is a new instruction it prints the literal value of the cell
